        <p>
          I’m Righteous, a passionate and detail-oriented Frontend Web Developer
          who loves turning designs into functional, accessible, and responsive
          websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey into tech started with a fascination for how websites
          worked. What began as curiosity quickly became a mission to create
          engaging user experiences using HTML, CSS, and modern frontend
          frameworks. I'm driven by a constant desire to learn, build, and
          improve.
        </p>
        <p class="quote uppercase center">
          <span class="colorful-letter">“Keep building, keep growing.”</span>
          That’s the mindset that fuels me daily.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m not just focused on making things look great—I’m also committed to
          clean code, performance, and user-first design. I see every project as
          a chance to grow both technically and creatively.

        <h2 class="main-title-large center">How it all started...</h2>
        <p>
          It all began during the lockdown. I came across a video explaining how
          websites are built, and I was instantly hooked. I didn’t have a tech
          background, but the idea of building something from scratch with code
          fascinated me.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">- A spark turned into purpose.</p>
        <p>
          I started teaching myself using YouTube and free online resources.
          Step by step, I began to understand HTML, CSS, and the power of design
          systems. Since then, I’ve been committed to this journey—building,
          breaking, and rebuilding to get better each day.

            One of my proudest accomplishments so far is designing a clean,
